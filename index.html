					<p>REVIVE ROLEPLAY.</p>
					<p>QOTD prompt bot</p>
					<p>Clean up the channels list (remove wordplay, remove some of the voice channels).</p>
					<p>Give the members a larger voice.</p>
					<p>Change the emojis at the end of each channel name to smth that has to do with the section.</p>
					<p>Possibly make it a community server so we can have better rule formatting, channel icons, and new member pruning.</p>
					<p>Stricter NSFW rules (but still allow cursing).</p>

				<h2 class="w3-text-grey w3-padding-16"><i class="fa fa-suitcase fa-fw w3-margin-right w3-xxlarge w3-text-teal"></i>What I can Do</h2>
				<div class="w3-container">
					<h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>I WILL REVIVE ROLEPLAY</b></h5>
					<p>I promise, I will not rest until roleplay is revived. DM me and I will give you the full plan.</p>
					<hr>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container">
					<h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>I can debug and fix permissions</b></h5>
					<p>I have much more experience than the rest of the applicants with this. I am willing to dish out the time to fix this server's perms. I've had problems with carl's lockdown not working too. Staff should be able to lock down the server or a channel on a moment's notice. I can help make that possible by debugging permissions.</p>
					<hr>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container">
					<h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>I can de-clutter the bots list</b></h5>
					<p>We don't need all of these bots, for example, we can kick game bot. In my server, certain bots, such as dank memer, were only available to use in #bots and #memes. This meant that you didn't have to see them de-cluttering the bots list because they weren't visible there. I don't know if you want that in the HM server, but that is an example of something I can do.<br><br>
					I can also de-clutter the channel list, for example, remove some of the extra voice channels, or archive #wordplay.</p><br>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container">
					<h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Fix the NSFW-ity</b></h5>
					<p>This is a pretty big problem in the server. I think we need stricter rules about nsfw in channels that aren't no mans land. We should also remove the snipe bot, however, we should still be allowed to curse because we're old enough to curse. If members do nothing but spam nsfw (for example carson), we have to consider punishments.</p><br>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container">
					<h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Give the members a larger voice.</b></h5>
					<p>I feel like member's suggestions in #suggestions often go unnoticed. Often, a staff member will just say "I'll think about it" and then never say more. I will make sure that we <i>genuinely</i> think about it.</p><br>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container">
					<h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>I will stop people from being toxic</b></h5>
					<p>Once upon a time, when the cereal-soup discussion was at its most tense, two of my mods (one of which was Kylan ofc), who were avid anti-soupers, tried to mute Marc the Shark, a random member who wasn't seriously in the argument, but was a pro-cereal-souper. This was the most toxic my server had ever been. I was able to not only stop the mods from muting Marc, but also got them to genuinely apologize. <b>This shows how I am good at mediating arguments.</b>
					<br><br>
					Here's another example. One day, Kylan decided to change his nickname to "oppressed" convinced two of his friends to do so as well. At first, I tried to just revoke nickname perms, but that wasn't a sustainable solution because they just got angrier. I next tried to ignore them, but they still didn't change their nicknames. Finally, I tried calmly negotiating with them. I was eventually able to get Kylan's friends to change their name back, and let Kylan change his name to 80s song lyrics.<br><br>
					Thus, I can mediate the server and make it less toxic.</p><br>

				<div class="w3-container">
					<h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>I have moderation experience</b></h5>
					<p>You all know already that I made my own math server from scratch. I have a ton of experience from that.</p>
					<hr>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container">
					<h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>I rarely feel angry</b></h5>
					<p>Sure, I have gotten into my fair share of arguments, but sitting next to the computer, I never really felt angry when talking on this server. This means you can trust me to not abuse my power.</p>
					<hr>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container">
					<h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>I will be consistently active</b></h5>
					<p>You might notice that my activity is mostly single comments, not full conversations. I might not have a high message count, but I read most of what is being said. I just don't often say stuff because I don't always know the full story. I'm not going to butt in where I don't belong. </p><br>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container">
					<h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Good ideas</b></h5>
					<p>I have good ideas about the server. I came up with all of these ideas on my own, and in the long term, I will always be having more.</p><br>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container">
					<h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>I have lots of time on my hands</b></h5>
					<p>I have lots of time to help the server. I will be able to do a lot.</p><br>
